Day-1 Introduction to Open Source SoC Design using Openlane:

1.1 What is a SoC?
SoC refers to the term System on a Chip. It is a single chip which integrates a whole electronic or a system into it. A SoC may contain digital, analog, mixed-signal devices on the same chip. In a traditional computer system architecture, each system component such as CPU, controller chips, a GPU, and RAM etc., used to be separately installed on the board, but thanks to technological advancements in the semiconductor industry has enabled more and more elements to be integrated in a single silicon chip.
 A current-day system on a chip (SoC) consists of several different components of a system such as the CPU (a microprocessor or microcontroller), memory, input/output (I/O) interface and wireless blocks, on a single silicon substrate. Most SoCs also use various pre-designed hardware block, called as IP Cores, to improve design time to market.

Since it has all the system components on one single chip, SoCs offer the advantages of reduced size, overall system cost, lower power consumption and Increased performance. SoCs are becoming increasingly popular with the growth of mobile computing and IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

1.2 SoC Design Flow:
SoC development process can be broken into multiple stages as illustrated in the following figure:
